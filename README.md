## 🚀 What I Do

- ⚙️ Build modern, responsive **web** and **desktop** applications (React, Next.js, Electron, Tkinter)
- 🤖 Develop and deploy **AI/ML models** for real-world use cases (voice assistants, real estate price prediction)
- 📡 Design secure and efficient **REST/GraphQL APIs** and integrate with Azure-hosted services
- 🧠 Create **offline AI solutions** using local LLMs (Ollama, Vosk) with privacy and performance in mind
- 🔧 Prototype **embedded systems** on Arduino & Raspberry Pi for IoT and real-time data collection
- 🔄 Automate workflows and internal tools with **Power Platform** (PowerApps, PowerAutomate)
